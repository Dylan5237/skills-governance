# Issues, PRs, and evidence

**Chat ≠ state.** If it is not on the Issue, PR, or git object, it did not happen.

## Playbooks

- [playbooks/issues-and-prs.md](../../playbooks/issues-and-prs.md)
- [playbooks/verification-and-evidence.md](../../playbooks/verification-and-evidence.md)
- [playbooks/blocked-and-exceptions.md](../../playbooks/blocked-and-exceptions.md)
- Templates: [templates/](../../templates/) · Labels: [templates/labels.md](../../templates/labels.md)

## Status (exactly one per issue)

`status:backlog` | `status:in-progress` | `status:blocked` | `status:verification` | `status:done`

## PR split (Principle 9)

| PR kind | Branch prefix | Template | Contains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Implementation | `feat/` `fix/` `docs/` | `templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/implementation.md` | product/library/test **code** |
| Evidence | `evidence/` | `templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/evidence.md` | replayable proofs only |

PR merge ≠ Phase PASS. Propose `EVIDENCE READY`; disposer writes `PHASE ACCEPT`.

## Agent checklist

1. Link every branch to an Issue. Empty issue bodies are invalid.
2. Copy Freeze text / ACK into the implementation PR.
3. Map each frozen acceptance test → proof (table).
4. On gaps: `BLOCKED:` comment + `status:blocked`.
5. Frozen field wrong → new Architecture Exception issue; do not edit-and-continue.
6. Redact secrets from logs.
7. On every status/gate flip: update Command Center **section 1** and the Phase status label. [ ] **CC §1 updated**. Cannot edit CC → `BLOCKED:` on GitHub, not chat-only.

Do not add a second control plane (chat logs, unofficial boards) as a substitute.
