# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — project operations binding

This repository is governed by the pinned `agent-project-ops` snapshot under `.agent-project-ops/`.

- Methodology: `{{METHODOLOGY_URL}}`
- PIN: `{{METHODOLOGY_SHA}}` (`{{METHODOLOGY_REF}}`, fetched {{FETCHED_AT}})
- Disposer: `{{DISPOSER}}`
- Write authority remote: `origin`
- Projection remote: `{{PROJECTION_REMOTE}}` (same-history FF only; not colleague GitLab)
- Colleague GitLab: share-export via `.agent-project-ops/scripts/share-export.sh` — never `git push --mirror` from this clone

## Always load first

Read `.agent-project-ops/PRINCIPLES.md`. Invariants win over convenience. Load the relevant skill wrapper under `.agents/skills/`; it points to the full pinned skill body.

Core rules:

1. Chat is not project state. Durable decisions/status belong on GitHub Issues/PRs/git objects.
2. Agent proposes; the named disposer freezes/Accepts/exceptions. PR merge is not Phase PASS.
3. `origin` (GitHub) is the only write authority. Projection remotes are same-history mirror/FF only. Colleague GitLab is share-export (filtered business tree), not a projection.
4. Unknown remotes fail closed. `.agent-project-ops/remotes` is the clone-portable registry.
5. Topic branches push to `origin` only. Never use a projection as a fallback when `origin` is unavailable. Never push this bound clone to colleague GitLab.
6. One task, one worktree under `.worktrees/`; keep the primary checkout clean for sync/control work.
7. Do not copy business/domain SOP back into the methodology snapshot or upstream methodology repository.

## Before your first push in this clone

`git clone` does **not** inherit `core.hooksPath`.

Run:

```bash
git config --get core.hooksPath
```

It must print `.githooks`. If it is empty or different, run:

```bash
bash .agent-project-ops/scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Then check `git remote -v` against `.agent-project-ops/remotes`. If an extra remote is unregistered, stop. If the registry names a projection that is not configured locally, restore/confirm it from the recorded project control plane before any projection operation.

A missing client hook is **not** permission to push `main`. The hook is bypassable; server-side repository policy remains the stronger control.

## Starting work

- No Command Center / first project setup: `.agent-project-ops/playbooks/start-project.md`
- New task: use `.agent-project-ops/scripts/new-worktree.sh` and the worktree playbook.
- Multiple remotes / same-history mirror / divergence: load `git-authority-and-projection` before any non-`origin` push.
- Colleague GitLab / business-files-only share: load `share-export`; do not register that host as projection.
- Cannot verify an invariant or remote state: fail closed and record `BLOCKED:` on the active Issue.
